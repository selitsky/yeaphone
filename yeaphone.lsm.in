    The goal of the Yeaphone project is to provide a user interface on a
    Yealink USB handset <http://www.yealink.com/en/index.asp> for the VoIP
    software Linphone thus making a PC keyboard and monitor unneccessary.
    This makes Yeaphone ideal for "Embedded Devices" which work very energy
    efficient but typically need an extra devices for user interaction (in
    this case the handset).
